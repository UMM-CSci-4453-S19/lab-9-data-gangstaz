select transId, sum(price) as total, min(timeStamp) as startTime, max(timeStamp) as stopTime,
timeDiff(max(timeStamp), min(timestamp)) as duration, user from transArchive group by transId;

## stopTime currently grabs the timestamp from last item entered into system,
not when the sale was actually completed/ended.
